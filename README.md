# 16-Bit-ALU

The **16-Bit ALU** is a Verilog-based digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logic operations on 16-bit inputs. It supports functions like addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and shifts, with status flags for result indication. This project showcases **digital design and VLSI fundamentals**.

This repository is for a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) project. The files from the earlier initial commit have been merged with this repository's content.

Next steps:
- Add project files (VHDL/Verilog/C/Python etc.) under `code/hdl/` or `code/src/`.
- Add build/run instructions and testbenches under `code/sim/`.
